# VendingMachine-MERN
Modeling a vending machine using React.js

Try out the React Vending Machine here. Insert coins, select a product, get back exact change, and remove the product from the machine. Also, feel free to play around with the the admin buttons for stocking products and coins.

This app was built from a coding exercise to create a model of a vending machine using only JavaScript. View the repository for the original project here.
